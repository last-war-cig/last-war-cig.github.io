Rallies in Doom Walkers require a certain strength, you will find in the table below.

If your rally against the Doom Walker does not have the required strength *in each squad participating*, the attack will fail. Other alliances may then attack the already damaged doom walker to get the rewards for cheap. So, as a rule of thumb:

> If your rally does not have the required strength, cancel it.


## Procedure

1. Check if your own squad fulfills the strength requirements. If not, do not start the rally.
2. Make sure players with squads strong enough can join the rally. If not, do not start the rally.
3. Start a 5 minute rally.
4. If the rally is not filled or players enter who are not strong enough: Cancel the rally.
5. If you join a rally, make sure the players that have joined thus far are strong enough.
