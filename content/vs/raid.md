Late Night Raids are raids conducted for a Vs battle at 00:00 server time on saturdays of week with a Vs battle.

The idea is to make as many points as possible with loosing as few troops as possible, to preserve them for the Capitol War (CW). To achieve that, only easy targets should be raided.


## Raid Targets


1. You want to have at least one troop tier between you and the base you are raiding.
2. Also, it has proven to be beneficial to have at least two HQ levels between you and the enemy.
3. However, you also do not want the troop tier of the enemy to be too low, since then you do not get good points for your efforts.

According to the above, you should select your raid targets:

| Your HQ level | Your troop tier | Optimal target troop tier | target HQ bracket |
| ------------- | --------------: | :------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 30            |              10 | 8 - 9                     | 24 - 28           |
| 29            |               9 | 7 - 8                     | 20 - 26           |
| 28            |               9 | 7 - 8                     | 20 - 26           |
| 27            |               9 | 7 - 8                     | 20 - 25           |
| 26            |               8 | 6 - 7                     | 17 - 23           |
| 25            |               8 | 6 - 7                     | 17 - 23           |
| 24            |               8 | 6 - 7                     | 17 - 22           |
| 23            |               7 | 5 - 6                     | 14 - 19           |
| 22            |               7 | 5 - 6                     | 14 - 19           |
| 21            |               7 | 5 - 6                     | 14 - 19           |
| 20            |               7 | 5 - 6                     | 14 - 18           |
| 19            |               6 | 3 - 4                     | 10 - 16           |
| 18            |               6 | 3 - 4                     | 10 - 16           |
| 17            |               6 | 3 - 4                     | 10 - 15           |
| 16            |               5 | 2 - 3                     | &le; 13           |
| 15            |               5 | 2 - 3                     | &le; 13           |
| 14            |               5 | 2 - 3                     | &le; 12           |

If everybody in a mixed raid team follows these brackets, it is more likely that everybody will make decent points, too.

## Before the raid


* You should be online about 10 minutes before raiding starts
* Voice chat has proven fun, I strongly recommend it.
* Remove the troops from your walls: You do not want to see them wasted in a counter attack!
* Have at least one random teleport in your inventory.
* Have a look at the enemy hive and try to identify an area most suitable for your bracket. For example, if you are a lv 19, try to find where most unshielded lv10 to lv 16 players of the enemy alliance hang out. That should be your jump destination.

## The Raid


As soon as you can jump over, do so as a group and immediately attack a target in your bracket.

The action loop goes like this:

1. Attack
2. Look at the battle report!
     1. If you kill decent troops, continue to attack. However, at one point there will be a decline in casualties. Go for the next target if this happens, usually after 3-5 attacks
     2. If you do not kill troops or just a few, select a new target.
     3. ***DO NOT WASTE STAMINA FOR ZEROING BASES OR JUST A FEW HUNDRED CASUALTIES!!!***
3. Choose wether to multi-tap or not: If you lost more than a couple of dozen troops, rather return to base and get new troops/heal. Otherwise, multi-tap.

If you are counterattacked by a sufficiently strong enemy, use the random teleport: It is a one click solution to get yourself out of trouble! Alternatively, if you have enough time: Simply jump back to your home server.

## After the raid

To safely return home after a raid, follow this procedure:

1. Jump back to your own server, but ***not*** to your hive. You want to have a good distance. This is to prevent you from being attacked while still under war fever, during which you can not use a shield. Alternatively, you can stay on the enemy server, if you are at a safe position.
2. Wait until war fever wears off.
3. Put up a shield.
4. Jump to the enemy's server
5. Jump back to your hive.
