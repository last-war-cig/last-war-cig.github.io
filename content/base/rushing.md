You want to bring your HQ to certain levels in order to unlock troop tiers available in those levels. Higher troop tiers provide a serious advantage during combat when compare to lower troops tiers.

{{< levels "base/levels.yaml" >}}

## Procedure

1. ***Build only what you need to reach the target level for your rush.***
2. Then upgrade **one** barack to the target level of your rush.
3. If you have two baracks, bring the second barrack to the level of one tier below your current HQ level. For example, when you reached HQ level 14 and upgraded the first barrack to level 14, you upgrade the second barrack to level 10. If you have three baracks, you bring your third barack to the level of two tiers below your HQ level and so on. The reason to do this is that you can upgrade troops rather quickly, and you do not want to waste ressources and precious build time on barracks.
4. After you have done so, go for the next rush milestone.

## Suggested milestones

* Level 10
* Level 17
* Level 24

After this, rushing becomes hard and expensive.
